# Exploratory-data-analysis

In this data analysis project, I aimed to explore and gain insights from crashes in Colorado Springs city dataset. First, I cleaned the data, handeled missing values, removed duplicates, covert data types and checked contradictions in the dataset.
Then, I did exploratory data analaysis, using statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover patterns and trends. In the end, I did advancced analaysis, using multiple variables and advanced graphs. I discovered interesting findings, such as which gender is more involved in accidents, which age group is more involved in severe accidents, and whether the involvement of a pedestrian, motorcycle, or bicycle affects the number of casualties.
